# Matrix_Operations
## Intention is to create a python implementation of matrices. This will include:
### 1. Creating a matrix
### 2. Basic matrix operations such as:
 - addition
 - subtraction
 - multplying by a constant
 - multiplying matrices
### 3. Determining if a matrix is invertible
### 4. Inverting matrices
### 5. Calculating the determinant of a matrix

## Once finished, this class will be used in a online calculator used to visualize all of these operations
