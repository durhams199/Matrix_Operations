# Matrix_Operations
## This is a Python implementation of matrices. This class includes:
### 1. Creating a matrix
### 2. Basic matrix operations such as:
 - addition
 - subtraction
 - multplying by a constant
 - multiplying matrices
### 3. Determining if a matrix is invertible
### 4. Inverting matrices
### 5. Calculating the determinant of a matrix

## Installation
### >= Python 3.6.4 is the only requirement

## Usage
### In order to run tests of class constructor and methods use:
> py Test.py
### Creating a Matrix:
#### In order to create a matrix you can assign it in the following way:
> matrix_1 = Matrix(a,b)
#### where "a" is the height of the matrix and "y" is the width.
#### This will create an a x b matrix where all values are "0"
### Editing values:
#### You can change values by using the set_row method in the following way:
> matrix_1.set_row(a, [x, y, z])
### where a is the row number (from 1 to the height), and [x,y,z] is a list of values of size = width

### List of all current methods in Matrix class:



## This class will be used in a online calculator used to visualize all of these operations
